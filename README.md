# Goodies-WebApp-Boilerplate
A WebApp Boilerplate with Foundation, Preefixfree, Obsessive Favicons, and more.

For quick app writting, or rapid prototyping static sites, I always end up using the smae basic setup. This is a boilerplate that helps speed up dev time.


What's under the hood?
<ul>
<li>Built using HTML5 Boilerplate.</li>
<li>Modernzr</li>
<li>PrefixFree</li>
<li>jQuery with Plugins</li>
<li>Foundation Framework CSS</li>
<li>All Foundation Plugins</li>
<li>Obssesive Compulsive Favicons</li>
<li>Google Analytics Script Tag</li>
<li>Default Foundation Stylings</li>
<li>Additional Meta Tag Info</li>
<li>Easy To Know Defaults To Change. Look For TODO's Listed In INDEX.HTML</li>
<li>All Vendor Scripts minified</li>
<li>All Vendor CSS minified</li>
<li>File Names And Structure More Representative Of CMS Dev Setup</li>
<li>JavaScript Called Before Ending Body Tag</li>
<br>
I plan on making a Bootstrap and Skeleton Framework equivalent. For script heavy apps, I'll also reproduce this with a more approriate file structure.
<br>
Thoughts on how to improve this are always welcome.
